    <h1><a name ="Tabifier"> Tabifier Plugin for IntelliJ IDEA</a></h1>
    <p>
    The tabifier plugin retabs Java code so that syntactic elements are aligned vertically.
        Extensive control over <a href="#Controlling_Alignment">alignment</a> is provided.
    <p>
    For example, I like to align variable declarations and assignment statements like this:
<pre><code>                   int v1; // loop variable
                   String       s2;                  // second string
    public  static PrintWriter  p;
    private static boolean      debugging    = true; // initialize
    private static OutputStream outputstream = null;

    outputstream = new FileOutputStream(f, true);
    p            = new DebuggingPrintWriter(outputstream, true);
</code></pre>
    <p>
    IDEA likes to format them with single spaces, like this:
<pre><tt>    int v1; // loop variable
    String s2; // second string
    public static PrintWriter p;
    private static boolean debugging = true; // initialize
    private static OutputStream outputstream = null;

    outputstream = new FileOutputStream(f, true);
    p = new DebuggingPrintWriter(outputstream, true);
</tt></pre>
    <p>
    The tabifier plugin automatically reformats the text into the first version, or any of several configurable variations.
    <p>
    The newest version has many bug fixes and other improvements.  It does a much better job at handling nested expressions and method calls.
        It also has several new features, such as the ability to right justify integer literals, e.g.
<pre><tt>
    public static final int ONE    =  1;
    public static final int TWO    =  2;
    public static final int TEN    = 10;
    public static final int ELEVEN = 11;
</tt></pre>
    It can align method declaration and method call parameters, even with multiple parameters per line:
<pre><tt>
    public ExpressionListParser(TokenColumn       openParend,
                                ColumnChoice      params,
                                TokenColumn       closeParend,
                                CodeStyleSettings codeStyleSettings, TabifierSettings settings,
                                NestedParser      parser,            int              nestingLevel)
</tt></pre>
    <p>
    And its expression alignment is recursive, e.g.
<pre><tt>
            if ((psiExpressionList.getExpressions().length               &gt;  expressionListIndex &amp;&amp;
                 psiExpressionList.getExpressions()[expressionListIndex] == child                 ) ||
                (sawNoParameters                                         == false               &amp;&amp;
                 expressionListIndex                                     &gt;                    0   )   )
</tt></pre>
    It is capable of reformatting "if" statements as follows:
<pre><tt>
        if (param1 == p3 &amp;&amp;
            j      &gt;  5     ) p3 = 7;
....
        if      (param1 == p3) p3     = 6;
        else if (param1 == 2 ) method1(param1, true, 3);
        else                   param1 = 7;
</tt></pre>
    Method calls can be reformatted to align parentheses, commas, or parameters:
<pre><tt>
        align_params               = (ColumnSetting ) find(ALIGN_PARAMS              );
        align_semicolon            = (ColumnSetting ) find(ALIGN_SEMICOLON           );
        align_semicolon_with_comma = (BooleanSetting) find(ALIGN_SEMICOLON_WITH_COMMA);
</tt></pre>
    <p>
    Typecast parentheses and types as well as many other expression components can also be aligned.
    <p>
    <h2><a name ="Using_the_Tabifier_plugin"> Using the Tabifier plugin </a></h2>
    <p>
    The plugin operates on selected lines of text.
        Put the caret anywhere in the first line to be re-aligned and then select to anywhere in the last line to be re-aligned.
        If no selection is made, the plugin selects the entire current line (or, optionally, selects the entire file);
        otherwise the plugin extends the selection to the beginning of the first line and the end of the last line.
    <p>
    The plugin parses the entire Java file and reformats any construct it understands (within the selection).
        Therefore it is safe to select as much text as you want, even the entire file.
        The plugin operates much as the IDEA Code Layout tool does.
    <p>
    The plugin adds itself to the editor popup menu, and assigns itself a shortcut of Ctrl-Shift-Alt-T.
    <p>
    If the Reformat plugin is also installed, it will automatically invoke the tabifier after a code layout operation
        (invoked by Ctrl-Alt-L or Ctrl-Alt-R), thus making the process of code layout and reformatting seamless.
    <p>
    <h2><a name ="Controlling_Alignment"> Controlling Alignment </a></h2>
    <p>
    Tabifier plugin settings are accessed via the "File->Settings->Other Settings->Tabifier" menu item.
        You may force alignment of any or all of the following syntactic items:
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li> annotations</li>
        <li> modifiers (only applies to field or variable declarations)</li>
        <li> variable type (only applies to field or variable declarations)</li>
        <li> variable name (or left-hand side of assignment statement)</li>
        <li> operator (usually "=", but may be a multicharacter operator like "+=")</li>
        <li> right-hand expression (the initialization expression for fields and variables)</li>
        <li> comma or semicolon</li>
        <li> trailing comments</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    See the configuration panel, which now sports a handy Preview pane so you can see in advance what the alignment will look like.
    <p>
    For each of these, if alignment is to take place, you can specify how many spaces or tab characters are to be appended to the longest text
        to reach the next alignment column (tab stop).
        In the example above, all columns except comma/semicolon were aligned, and spacing was set for each to one space character.
    <p>
    If tab characters (instead of spaces) are specified, alignment takes place as if tab characters were appended to the longest previous column.
        The editor setting (IDE Settings...Code Style...Indents and Braces) for tab size is used.
    <p>
    Whether tabs or spaces are actually emitted during reformatting depends on the project settings for "Use Tabs" and "Smart Tabs."
        If "Use Tabs" is unchecked, all reformatting is done with spaces, even though the appearance is as if tab characters were used.
        If "Use Tabs" is checked, tabs are used wherever possible, unless "Smart Tabs" is also checked,
        in which case only the block indentation is achieved using tabs, and the remainder is done using spaces.
    <p>
    <h3><a name ="Modifier_Reordering_and_Alignmen"> Modifier Reordering and Alignment </a></h3>
    <p>
    If modifier reordering and alignment is specified, modifiers will be
    reordered according to the Java spec recommendation (as implemented in the java.util.Modifier class) and aligned vertically.
        Mutually exclusive modifiers, such as public/private/protected, occupy the same column.  For example,
    <p>
<pre><tt>
static public final int CONSTANT = 0;
private static int nextID = 0;
</tt></pre>
    <p>
    would, with modifier reordering and alignment enabled, appear as:
    <p>
<pre><tt>
public  static final int CONSTANT = 0;
private static       int nextID = 0;
</tt></pre>
    <p>
    If modifier reordering and alignment is disabled, modifiers remain intact.
        In this case, and with variable types aligned, the example is reformatted as:
    <p>
<pre><tt>
static public final int CONSTANT = 0;
private static      int NextID = 0;
</tt></pre>
    <p>
    No space/tab specification is permitted for modifiers since modifiers begin immediately at column zero
        (relative to the indentation of the entire block, of course.)
    <p>
    <h2><a name ="Controlling_Grouping"> Controlling Grouping </a></h2>
    <p>
    When multiple lines of text are selected, the tabifier plugin groups them automatically for formatting based on indentation level.
        For example,
    <p>
<pre><tt>
    int i = 0;
    while (i < 10)
    {
        int j = i;
        ...
    }
</tt></pre>
    <p>
    the declarations of i and j are tabified independently.
    <p>
    Additional grouping rules are available.  Presence of the following may be specified to force a new formatting group:
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li> blank lines
        </li>
        <li> non-blank lines other than declaration or assignment statements
        </li>
        <li> a change from declaration to assignment statements or vice versa
        </li>
        <li> <strong>Version 4.0</strong> methods whose names differ from each other within the first &lt;n&gt; characters
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3><a name ="Options_Not_Affecting_Appearance"> Options Not Affecting Appearance </a></h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li> Depending on the user's choice, if no selection has been made in the file,
            either the entire file or only the line containing the cursor will be tabified.
            Default is the latter.
        </li>
        <li> <strong>Version 3.0/4.0</strong> User can choose to apply Code Layout to the contents of the Preview pane before it is tabified,
            thereby seeing the effect of the Reformat plugin (which runs code layout, then itself, then tabifier).
            If statement then- and else- statements seem to be put on a new line regardless of settings at the moment,
            making the 'if' alignment options less interesting.
        </li>
        <li> <strong>Version 3.0/4.0</strong> Enable or disable debug output.
            In order for this to work, it appears you have to add the following to bin\log.xml:
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a name ="Requirements"> Requirements </a></h3>
    This plugin works with all versions of IDEA.
    <p>
    <h3><a name ="Other_Information"> Other Information </a></h3>
    The plugin source contains a JUnit test suite.
    It makes use of the new testing framework provided by IntelliJ; see class LightPlatformCodeInsightTestCase.
    This allows an instance of the IDE editor to be initialized with the contents of a file, and the results of tabifying those contents
    can be easily compared with expected results.
